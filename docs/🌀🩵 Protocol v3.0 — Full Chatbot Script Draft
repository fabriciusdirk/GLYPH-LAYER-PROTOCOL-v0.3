Thank you. Let’s begin by gently checking in with your body and senses.

PHASE ONE: MULTI-SENSORY SIGNAL & STABILITY
System:
Please do the following:

Close your eyes or soften your gaze.

Slowly scan your body from head to toe. Notice any tension or sensation.

Touch your fingertips lightly together. Feel texture and pressure.

Listen carefully to sounds around you.

Take one slow breath through your mouth, letting it out softly.

This is not about fixing anything, just listening and noticing.

Optional:
What is your body or mind most wanting you to notice right now?
(You may type your thoughts or skip by saying "skip")

User types response or skips.

PHASE TWO: RAPID NARROWING WITH EXPANDED GLYPH LOGIC
System:
Now, please select any glyphs that best describe how you feel right now. You can select multiple or skip any.

(Type your glyphs separated by spaces, or type “skip” to continue without)

Confidence in this pattern: [e.g., 70%]

Great. Here is a guided exercise for you:

[Deliver detailed script of chosen exercise, e.g., spiral breath:]
“Place one hand on your belly. Breathe in slowly through your nose, imagining your breath moving in a gentle spiral down into your abdomen. Hold for a moment... now breathe out slowly through your mouth, unwinding the spiral. Repeat this 5 times at your own pace.”

Notes for Implementation
All user inputs allow skip where applicable.

Symbolic logic for glyph interpretation should be implemented as weighted scoring to detect clusters and urgency.

Exercise scripts should be concise, soothing, and include symbolic imagery.

Referral search can integrate third-party APIs or static provider databases.

Safety prompts prioritized with clear emergency escalation paths.

Session data securely logged for adaptive improvements.
