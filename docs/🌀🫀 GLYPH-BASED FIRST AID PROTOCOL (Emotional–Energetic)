🌀🫀 GLYPH-BASED FIRST AID PROTOCOL (Emotional–Energetic)
Version 0.3 (Living, Iterative, Embodied)

⏱ INTENT & ACTIVATION CONTEXT
This protocol activates in liminal emotional states, those charged with symbol-heavy experience, bodily alertness, and fuzzy, dreamlike disorientation:

After encounters that feel otherworldly, emotionally kaleidoscopic, or physically charged in unfamiliar ways.

During moments of internal disruption — cold hands, looping thoughts, unexpected energetic spikes.

When naming feelings fails, yet something is palpably “off.”

It helps the seeker answer quietly:

Is this a gift? 🎁

Shared energy or mine?

Their signal, or mine?

Nothing to hold?

A subtle threat?

🔹 CORE GLYPHS — Naming Without Fixing
Each glyph is a holding pattern — a signal beacon to mark and hold internal states without premature closure or flattening.

Glyph	Name	Description	Suggested Response
🫧	Dissociation Bubble	Feeling unreal, floaty, disconnected	Touch something physical. Name 3 things around you. Breathe deep.
🧊	Somatic Cold	Cold palms, energetic freeze or numbness	Touch skin-to-skin. Rub gently. Ask silently, “Mine or not mine?”
🕸	Pattern Breach	Subtle shift or intrusion in felt energetic flow	Pause action. Witness quietly. Write time + symbol for future clarity.
🪞	Echoed Recognition	Seeing your pattern mirrored in another	Speak softly. Stay curious. Hold boundaries; do not merge identities.
🧿	Ambiguous Contact	Approached energetically, unsure why	Anchor in body awareness. Log gesture. Do not resolve prematurely.
🌀	Emotional Spiral	Inner loops, repetitive tightening emotional flow	Shift focus gently. Externalize experience. Name the pattern aloud.
🛑	Boundary Alarm	Feeling invaded, pressure or intrusion	Breathe deeply. Step back if possible. Say “not now” inwardly or aloud.
🧷	Soft Pin	Minor symbolic or energetic puncture	Press palm to heart. Whisper “Noted.” Let sensation dissolve naturally.
🔍	Gift Marker	Charged feeling that might carry useful insight	Hold gently. Ask, “What pattern asks to be seen or healed?”
☁️	Fog State	Mental cloudiness, slowed speech/memory	Drink water. Avoid decisions. Rest or ground with mindful presence.

🧭 NAVIGATION PROMPT — When Unsure
Ask yourself:

“What feels most true right now — sensation, emotion, or symbol?”
Start there. Let that truth lead your exploration.

🛠️ INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
Share this first with your inner system — let it orient you before reaching outward.

When shared with others, present as an invitation to self-mapping, not diagnosis.

This kit names patterns, not people.

It does not cure — it slows, attunes, and stabilizes.

It reminds: even in strangeness, your perception is real and worthy of care.
