🧍🎭 GLYPH LAYER PROTOCOL v0.3
Navigation Guidance Glyph Set — A Symbolic Map for Situational Awareness, Systemic Interaction, and Embodied Presence

Purpose
The 🧍🎭 GLYPH LAYER PROTOCOL provides a symbolic map designed to enhance situational awareness and systemic interaction. These glyphs function as intuitive guides for navigating the complexities of emotional, cognitive, and relational spaces, supporting embodiment and fluid decision-making without rigid structures.

This protocol emphasizes the importance of embodied presence, curiosity, and slow, mindful engagement with both external environments and inner states.

Additional v0.2 Features
Ritual Micro-Gestures: Each glyph includes an optional subtle body movement or breath pattern to deepen embodiment and intuitive access.

Dual Awareness: Encourage users to hold both the symbolic meaning and felt-sense simultaneously — the mind and the body, the known and the felt.

Layer Interaction: Many glyphs intentionally pair or sequence with others (e.g., 🧍🧱 followed by 📦🚪 to signal pause then expansion), supporting fluid narrative navigation.

Protocol Notes:
This protocol is designed for situational fluidity, symbolic depth, and embodied presence. It offers a map for navigating the complexities of human experience, allowing both cognitive clarity and emotional resonance to coexist in a high-bandwidth, interactive dialogue. The glyphs invite us to step lightly, observe deeply, and engage with intention as we navigate both internal landscapes and external systems.
